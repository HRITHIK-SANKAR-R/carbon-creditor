Project Title: "Carbon Ledger" - An Auditable GHG Accounting & Decarbonization MVP

1. Introduction: The Business Imperative

Modern businesses face increasing pressure from regulators, investors, and consumers to manage their environmental impact. The primary challenge, especially for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), is the complexity and perceived cost of accurate carbon accounting. The risk of "greenwashing" (making unsubstantiated environmental claims) is high, and the lack of clear guidance prevents meaningful action. The Carbon Ledger MVP addresses this gap by providing a simple, credible, and internationally compliant platform to measure, understand, and act upon greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

2. The MVP Solution: Simplicity through Standardization

The Carbon Ledger MVP is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to be the single source of truth for a company's carbon footprint. It is not a complex estimation tool but a guided ledger. By focusing on verifiable activity data (like fuel invoices and electricity bills), the platform provides an auditable baseline that can withstand scrutiny. Our MVP will empower companies to move from ambition to action, providing not just the "what" (their emissions) but also the "how" (feasible, industry-specific reduction strategies).

3. Core Principle: Unwavering Adherence to International Standards

This is the bedrock of the Carbon Ledger's credibility. All methodologies, calculations, and classifications within the MVP are directly aligned with the world's most recognized frameworks. This non-negotiable principle ensures that the outputs are reliable, comparable, and ready for corporate reporting or third-party verification.

The GHG Protocol: The Global Standard for Accounting:

The platformâ€™s entire data collection structure is built on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. This is the most widely used international accounting tool for quantifying emissions.

We will explicitly guide the user through the three "Scopes":

Scope 1: Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (e.g., fuel burned in company vehicles and generators).

Scope 2: Indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy (primarily electricity).

Scope 3: All other indirect emissions in the value chain (simplified for the MVP).

ISO 14064: The Standard for Verification:

While the MVP will not offer verification, it is designed from the ground up to be verifiable. The platform's emphasis on uploading documentary evidence (invoices, bills) for all major data points aligns with the principles of ISO 14064-1, which specifies the requirements for designing and developing a GHG inventory.

IPCC Emission Factors Database:

All calculations within the MVP will be performed using emission factors published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), supplemented by nationally-recognized databases (e.g., CEA in India, EPA in the US) for location-specific accuracy, particularly for Scope 2 electricity.

4. Target Audience for MVP

The MVP is specifically tailored for Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (10-250 employees) in sectors with tangible operational footprints, such as light manufacturing, logistics, professional services with significant office space, and retail. These organizations have the need and the desire to act but lack the in-house expertise and resources for complex consulting engagements.

Page 2: The User Journey: A Step-by-Step Workflow

This section describes the end-to-end user experience, detailing the flow from initial setup to actionable insights.

Step 1: Secure Onboarding & Profile Setup
The user's first interaction is a guided setup wizard. This initial data collection is crucial as it creates the context for all subsequent calculations.

Company Information: The user enters their company name, industry, scale (employee count), and the primary location(s) of operation.

Industry Classification: To ensure suggestions are relevant, the user selects their industry from a standardized list (e.g., NAICS or ISIC codes).

Location, Location, Location: The physical address of each facility is critical. The platform will use this to automatically apply the correct regional electricity grid emission factor for Scope 2 calculations, a key requirement for accuracy.

Step 2: Guided Data Collection (The "Activity Log")
This is the core of the user's monthly interaction. The interface is a simple, intuitive set of forms, broken down by the internationally recognized GHG Protocol Scopes.

Inputting Scope 1 Data:

The user is prompted: "Enter the total liters of diesel purchased for generators this month."

They input the value (e.g., "1200") and are prompted to upload a scanned copy or photograph of the corresponding fuel invoices. This "evidence-first" approach is central to the MVP's auditable nature.

Similar forms exist for company vehicles, natural gas consumption, etc.

Inputting Scope 2 Data:

The user is prompted: "Enter the total kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed from your electricity bill this month."

They input the value and upload a copy of the bill. The system already knows the facility's location from Step 1.

Inputting Scope 3 Data (Simplified for MVP):

To make the MVP achievable, Scope 3 is limited to the most common and easily tracked categories.

Waste: "Enter the total weight (kg) of general waste sent to landfill." (Evidence: Waste contractor invoices).

Business Travel: "Enter the total distance (km) of flights taken by employees." (Evidence: Travel reports).

Step 3: Automated Calculation & Baseline Generation
Once the data for a period (e.g., one month) is submitted, the user clicks "Calculate My Baseline."

The Backend Process (Non-AI): The platform's secure Calculation Engine multiplies the user's activity data by the relevant, pre-loaded international emission factors. For example: 1200 liters of Diesel * 2.68 kg CO2e/liter = 3216 kg CO2e.

The Common Unit: All outputs are converted to the standard metric of tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). This allows for accurate comparison across different activities.

The Result: The system generates the company's first verifiable Carbon Baseline Report for that period.

Step 4: The Emissions Dashboard & Insights
The calculated data is presented in a simple, easy-to-understand dashboard.

Headline Figure: Total tCO2e for the month.

Breakdown by Scope: A pie chart showing the percentage of emissions from Scope 1, 2, and 3. For most SMEs, Scope 2 will be dominant, providing an immediate area of focus.

Top Emission Sources: A bar chart that clearly identifies the biggest contributors (e.g., "Grid Electricity: 65%", "Diesel for Generator: 20%"). This is the most important insight for the user.

Step 5: The Suggestion Chatbot (The "What Next?")
After reviewing their dashboard, the user can engage with a chatbot for guidance.

Trigger: The user clicks a button like "How can I reduce this?"

Contextual Analysis: The chatbot's logic is pre-programmed to analyze the dashboard data. It sees that "Grid Electricity" is the top source of emissions.

Tailored Suggestions: Based on the user's industry and the data, the chatbot provides rule-based, feasible suggestions directly aligned with the 8 rules you provided (e.g., suggesting a "Smart Power-Down Policy" for an IT company, or "Preventative Maintenance on Machinery" for a manufacturing company).

Page 3: MVP Features & Deliverables: Core Modules

This section defines the specific, tangible features that will be built for the MVP. This is a non-AI implementation, focusing on a robust, rule-based system.

Module 1: The Data Entry & Verification Portal

User Authentication: Secure user sign-up and login.

Company Profiling: A one-time setup wizard for company details (industry, scale, location).

Form-Based Activity Log: Simple web forms for entering monthly consumption data, strictly categorized by Scope 1, 2, and 3. Each entry field will be linked to a required document upload.

Evidence Locker: A secure file storage system to hold all uploaded verification documents (bills, invoices). This is the cornerstone of the platform's auditable design.

Module 2: The Calculation Engine (Local, Rule-Based)

Emission Factor Database: A secure, internal database populated with emission factors from the latest IPCC reports and relevant national authorities (e.g., CEA, EPA). This database is the "brain" of the calculation and is not user-facing. It will be updatable by the system administrator as new international guidance is released.

Core Calculation Logic: A backend service that takes the verified activity data from the user and multiplies it by the appropriate factor from the database to generate the final tCO2e value. The logic is auditable, traceable, and free from "black box" AI calculations.

Report Generator: A simple function that aggregates the monthly data into a downloadable PDF summary, showing total emissions and the breakdown by scope.

Module 3: The Dashboard & Suggestion Chatbot (Rule-Based, No AI)

Data Visualization: The frontend dashboard will feature three main components:

A "Total Emissions" KPI card.

A pie chart for the "Breakdown by Scope."

A bar chart for "Top Emission Sources."

Rule-Based Suggestion Chatbot: This is the interactive element for the MVP. It is not a learning model (like an LSTM) but an "Expert System."

Predefined Suggestion Library: A database containing a curated list of short-term and long-term reduction initiatives. Each suggestion is tagged with the industry, company scale, and emission source it addresses.

Simple Logic Engine: The chatbot's "intelligence" is a series of if-then statements. For example:

IF dashboard.top_emission_source == "Grid Electricity" AND profile.company_type == "IT Services"

THEN display suggestions tagged with 'electricity' and 'IT Services'

This ensures all 8 of your specified rules are strictly followed, as the chatbot can only provide pre-written, expert-approved advice relevant to the user's specific, data-driven context.

Out of Scope for this MVP:

Full Scope 3 emissions accounting.

Real-time data integration with smart meters or IoT devices.

Purchase or trading of carbon credits.

An LSTM generative model for the chatbot. The focus is on a reliable, auditable, rule-based system first.
